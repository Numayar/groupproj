            <h1>Lucky</h1>
            <p>
              Lucky here was rescued not too far from an apartment fire. It has
              been five months since and nobody has came to calm him, we are
              hoping he can find his new forever home.
            </p>
            <p>
              Loves to play with yarn and sit up watching everything around him.
              He also enjoys head scratches and cuddling up by your feet.

            <h2>Tiger</h2>
            <p>
              Tiger was found wandering in a junkyard, tired, lonely, and
              hungry. Being in the shelter for almost a year now we have
              realized how friendly and easily adaptable he is to new
              environments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Enjoys naptime at least three times a day along with a quiet and
              more relaxed setting. Loves to stay in the sun often and does not
              eat too much.
            </p>

            <h3>Midnight</h3>
            <p>
              Midnight here has always been our most well behaved dog. He is
              truly a pup at heart. Sadly, his owner passed a few years back and
              he has been moved from home to home since. We are actively trying
              to find a home for him.
            </p>
            <p>
              Loves kids and plays very gently with them. Can easily go from
              being energetic playing a game of fetch, to simply laying with you
              watching an old movie.
            </p>

            <h3>Rolo</h3>
            <p>
              Rolor was found in front of a supermarket in a little box along
              with his siblings who have been adopted not too long ago.
            </p>
            <p>
              He is really shy and does not take well to very loud noise or
              unpredictable movement (he gets scared easily). Approach with
              gentleness and you will capture his heart. He really loves to
              tangle himself up in extra fluffy blankets with his carrot chew
              toy.
